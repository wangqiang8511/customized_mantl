# Microservices-Infrastructure becomes MANTL  
#FAQ.

If you're naturally sceptical about change, then this FAQ may be for you.

#### Q: What's happening to Microservices-Infrastructure?
A: Nothing bad! Same project, same goals, just a new, shorter name which makes it easier to talk about. We felt a project this good deserved a proper brand.

#### Q: It's staying open-source right?
A: **Absolutley**, yes.

#### Q: How do I contribute?
 A: Same as always, raise a pull request. All of our current roadmap/tasks are visible in the 'issues' section of the repo. 

#### Q: Will the repo/docs/naming be changing.
A: Yes, over the next few days, we'll be changing the github repo to ciscocloud/mantl, as well as updating any references to 'microservices-infrastructure' in the docs.

We haven't done this right away as we wanted to provide time for automation checks for our existing development community.

#### Q: What about people that come back to the repo after a few weeks/months?
A: we'll be creating a new microservices-infrastructure repo which information on the rename and links to the new location.

#### Q: What if I have a problem/concern with the mantl.io website?
A: Please raise an issue in the github repo, just as you would for any other bug and we'll get right on it!
