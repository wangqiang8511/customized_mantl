This is mirror of [MANTL](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure)

# Changes from the original repo:

* instance group, separate coordination services with mesos
  Now have control, master, worker
* use ubuntu as base
* mainly focus on aws

* [mesos-consul](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/mesos-consul) populating Consul service discovery with Mesos tasks
* [marathon-consul](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/marathon-consul) update consul k/v with Marathon tasks
* Multi-datacenter support
* High availability
* Security

### Architecture

The base platform contains control nodes that manage the cluster and any number of resource nodes. Containers automatically register themselves into DNS so that other services can locate them.

![Single-DC](docs/_static/single_dc.png)

Once WAN joining is configured, each cluster can locate services in other data centers via DNS or the [Consul API](http://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html).

![Mult-DC](docs/_static/multi_dc.png)

### Control Nodes

The control nodes manage a single datacenter.  Each control node runs Consul for service discovery, Mesos leaders for resource scheduling and Mesos frameworks like Marathon.

In general, it's best to provision 3 or 5 control nodes to achieve higher availability of services. The Consul Ansible role will automatically bootstrap and join multiple Consul nodes. The Mesos Ansible role will provision highly-availabile Mesos and ZooKeeper environments when more than one node is provisioned.

![Control Node](docs/_static/control_node.png)

### Resource Nodes

Resource nodes launch containers and other Mesos-based workloads.

![Resource Node](docs/_static/resource_node.png)

## Getting Started

All development is done on the `master` branch. Tested, stable versions are identified via git tags.

```
    git clone https://github.com/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure.git

```

To use a stable version, use `git tag` to list the stable versions:

```
git tag
0.1.0
0.2.0
...
0.3.0

git checkout 0.3.0
```

A Vagrantfile is provided that provisions everything on a single VM. To run, first ensure that your system has 4GB of RAM free, then:

```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
./security-setup
vagrant up
```

Note:
* There is no support for Windows at this time, however support is planned.
* Vagrant 1.7.3+ is required for best results.
* There is no support for the VMware Fusion Vagrant provider; hence your provider is set to Virtualbox in your Vagrantfile. In order to start running just issue the `vagrant up` command.


### Software Requirements

Requirements for running the project are listed in `requirements.txt`. Of note: Ansible 1.9 or later is required; also Python 2.7 is required. All the software requirements are currently distributed as Python modules, and you can `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get them all at once.

### Deploying on multiple servers

Please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://microservices-infrastructure.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started/index.html), which covers multi-server and OpenStack deployments.

## Documentation

All documentation is located at [https://microservices-infrastructure.readthedocs.org](https://microservices-infrastructure.readthedocs.org/en/latest).

To build the documentation locally, run:

```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
cd docs
make html
```

## Development

If you're interested in contributing to the project, install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and the Python modules listed in `requirements.txt` and follow the Getting Started instructions. To build the docs, enter the `docs` directory and run `make html`. The docs will be output to `_build/html`.

Good issues to start with are marked with the [low hanging fruit](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22low+hanging+fruit%22) tag.

## Getting Support

If you encounter any issues, please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure) against the project. We review issues daily.

We also have a [gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure). Drop by and ask any questions you might have. We'd be happy to walk you through your first deployment.

[Cisco Intercloud Services](https://developer.cisco.com/cloud) provides support for OpenStack based deployments of Microservices Infrastructure.
