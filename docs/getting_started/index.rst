Getting Started
===============

.. note:: This document assumes you have a `working Ansible
          installation`_. If you don't, install Ansible before
          continuing. This can be done simply by running ``pip install -r
          requirements.txt`` from the root of the project.

The Microservices Infrastructure project uses Ansible to bring up
nodes and clusters. This generally means that you need three things:

 1. hosts to use as the base for your cluster
 2. an `inventory file`_ with the hosts you want to be modified.
 3. a playbook to show which components should go where.

Provisioning Cloud Hosts
------------------------

The playbooks and roles in this project will work on whatever provider
(or metal) you care to spin up, as long as it can run CentOS 7 or
equivalent. However, here are some guides to get started on common
platforms:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   openstack.rst
   gce.rst
   aws.rst
   digitalocean.rst
   vsphere.rst
   softlayer.rst

Setting up DNS
--------------

Terraform lets you configure DNS for your instances. The DNS provider is
loosely coupled from the server provider, so you could for example use
the dnsimple provider for either OpenStack or AWS hosts.

These are the supported DNS providers:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   dnsimple.rst

Setting up Authentication and Authorization
-------------------------------------------

Before you begin, you'll want to run the ``security-setup`` script in the
root directory. This will create and set passwords, authentication, and
certificates. For more information, see the :doc:`security-setup
<../security/security_setup>` documentation.

Deploying software via Ansible
------------------------------

.. note:: Ansible requres a Python 2 binary. If yours is not at /usr/bin/python,
          please view the `Ansible FAQ <http://docs.ansible.com/faq.html>`_. You
          can add an extra variable to the following commands, e.g.
          ``ansible -e ansible_python_interpreter=/path/to/python2``.

In the following examples, we're going to assume you deployed hosts using
Terraform. This project ships with a dynamic inventory file to read Terraform
``.tfstate`` files. To use it, just use the ``-i
plugins/inventory/terraform.py`` argument of ``ansible`` or
``ansible-playbook``.

First, ping the servers to ensure they are reachable via ssh:

.. code-block:: shell

  ansible all -i plugins/inventory/terraform.py -m ping 

If any servers fail to connect, check your connection by adding ``-vvvv``
for verbose SSH debugging and try again to view the errors in more detail.

Next, deploy the software. First, you'll need to customize a playbook. A sample
can be found at ``terraform.sample.yml`` in the root directory, you can find
more about customizing this at :doc:`playbook`. The main change you'll want
to make is changing ``consul_acl_datacenter`` to your preferred ACL datacenter.
If you only have one datacenter, you can remove this variable. Next, assuming
you've placed the filled-out template at ``terraform.yml``:

.. code-block:: shell

  ansible-playbook -i plugins/inventory/terraform.py -e @security.yml terraform.yml

The deployment will probably take a while as all tasks are completed.

Checking your deployment
------------------------

If the playbooks are successful, you should be able to reach the web consoles
for Mesos (on control nodes port 5050), Marathon (port 8080) and Consul (port
8500.)

Customizing your deployment
---------------------------

Below are guides customizing your deployment:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ssh_users.rst  
   playbook.rst
   dockerfile.rst

.. _generated dynamically: http://docs.ansible.com/intro_dynamic_inventory.html
.. _inventory file: http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html
.. _playbook: http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks.html
.. _working Ansible installation: http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html#installing-the-control-machine

Restarting your deployment
--------------------------

To restart your deployment and make sure all components are restarted and
working correctly, use the ``playbooks/reboot-hosts.yml`` playbook.

.. code-block:: shell

    ansible-playbook playbooks/reboot-hosts.yml

Using a Docker Container to Provision your Cluster
---------------------------------------------------

You can also provision your cluster by running a docker container. See :doc:`dockerfile` for more information.
