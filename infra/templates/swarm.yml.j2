          pointing to your `security.yml` (e.g., `-e @security.yml`)

# BASICS - we need every node in the cluster to have common software running to
# increase stability and enable service discovery. You can look at the
# documentation for each of these components in their README file in the
# `roles/` directory, or by checking the online documentation at
# microservices-infrastructure.readthedocs.org.
